    # Overture: The Future of Enterprise Frontend Development
</center>

## The Problem: Enterprise Frontend Chaos

Enterprises face a hidden crisis:
- **Tool Fragmentation**: Teams juggle 5+ disconnected tools, leading to zero visibility across the component ecosystem and 40% wasted developer time.
- **The Component Graveyard**: Ghost components, zombie duplicates, orphaned code, and documentation decay create inconsistent user experiences.
- **Migration Nightmare**: Framework migrations result in 6-12 months of lost productivity and complete workflow disruption, preventing technological evolution.

## The Solution: Overture - Kubernetes for React Components

Overture orchestrates your existing tools into one intelligent workflowâ€”no rip-and-replace required. Leveraging the universal truth that every frontend framework compiles to vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, Overture provides true framework-agnostic orchestration.

## Platform Capabilities

- **Universal Component Registry**: Auto-discovery from any source, privacy-first AI (your keys), semantic search, and duplicate detection.
- **Visual Page Composer**: Build and prototype pages with a drag-and-drop interface using your existing components, with export to production code, real-time collaboration, and AI-assisted composition.
- **Migration Intelligence**: Analyze and automate framework migrations with AI-powered tools, offering framework-agnostic analysis, Netflix-style performance analysis, smart architecture recommendations, and universal code transformation.
- **Performance Orchestration**: Enhance your application's performance with insights and real-time analytics, implementing strategies to optimize load times and user experience.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form that saves submissions to a local JSON file.
- **Contact View**: A page to view all contact form submissions.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
